# Team Management
Team management is a crucial aspect of our software as a service website builder platform, enabling agencies to effectively collaborate, delegate tasks, and streamline project workflows. Our platform offers robust features for managing teams within agencies, ensuring seamless communication, coordination, and productivity.

## User Roles
Our platform supports three main user roles within agencies:

 1. Agency Owner: The agency owner is the primary account holder who has full access and control over the agency account and its subaccounts. They can create and manage subaccounts, assign user roles and permissions, and oversee all agency operations.

 2. Agency Admin: Agency admins are users with administrative privileges assigned by the agency owner. They have access to agency management functionalities and can manage other subaccount users within the agency. However, they do not have default access to subaccount modules and can only access the agency module by default.

 3. Subaccount User: Subaccount users are responsible for managing individual client projects within the agency. They have access to specific subaccounts assigned to them by the agency owner or admin. Subaccount users can create and customize websites, handle software development pipelines, and communicate with clients.

## Permissions Management
Our platform offers granular permissions management, allowing agency owners and admins to assign specific permissions to subaccount users based on their roles and responsibilities. Permissions can be customized to control access to various modules, features, and functionalities within the platform, ensuring data security and privacy.

## Collaboration Tools

 Task Management: Task management tools enable users to create, assign, and track tasks within projects, ensuring accountability and progress tracking.
 File Sharing: Users can share files and documents securely within the platform, streamlining collaboration on project deliverables and assets.
