# Funnel Steps
Funnel steps are the individual web pages that collectively form a complete funnel within our software as a service website builder platform. Each funnel step represents a distinct stage in the customer journey, guiding visitors through the conversion process and ultimately driving desired actions such as sign-ups, purchases, or inquiries.
